# Driver_Drowsiness_Detection

## Description

This was our projet for the Embedded System Design Class wherein we proposed a system for early Prevention of accidents. Our project uses Face Recognition technology to monitor the vehicle continuously and also to access and control remotely. The IoT devices placed in vehicles are designed and are acquainted with sensors to prevent accidents immediately. The system is also acquainted with a camera to detect drowsiness of the driver and alarm a buzzer when the driver, and if detected signal a high output alarm.proposes a system for early Prevention of accidents.

## Features

- Modern Safety features like Image Processing and IOT involved in working on this project.

- Project utilizes car system to sound buzzer and turn on the Turn Lights indicator in parking mode to notify nearby cars that someone is asleep in this car


- Using minimal complexity in algorithms and logic the system is very fast and can be very spontaneous while preventing any accident.

## Techstack used

Arduino uno : To act as the processing hub for the code.

Opencv library in python : To find and calculate the facial symptoms of sleepiness
